Part 1: Navigation & File Manipulation

- Where am I? pwd (Print Working Directory)
- What’s here? ls -lah (List all files, including hidden .env files, with human-readable sizes).
- The "CRUD" of Files:
```
mkdir devops-practice (Create a folder)
touch server.log (Create an empty file)
cp server.log server.log.bak (Copy/Backup)
mv server.log ./devops-practice/ (Move)
rm server.log.bak (Delete—be careful, there is no Trash Bin in Linux!)
```

Part 2: Devops debugging
These are the commands you'll use to debug a failing Node.js production server.

1. Grep (Search)
Imagine your access.log has 10,000 lines. You only want to see 404 errors.
```
grep "404" access.log
```
2. Tail (Monitoring)
Watch your logs in real-time as requests hit your Express server:
```
tail -f access.log
```
3. Permissions (The "Permission Denied" Fixer)
Understand chmod.
```
chmod 400 key.pem: Makes a file read-only (required for AWS SSH keys).
chmod +x script.sh: Makes a script executable.
```

Part 3: Practice:
Perform this sequence to prove you've mastered the basics:

- Create a directory called mern-logs. mkdir mern-logs
- Inside it, create a file named app.log. touch app.log
- Add 5 lines of dummy text to it (use echo "Error: Connection failed" >> app.log). nano app.log
- Search the file for the word "Error" and save the result into a new file called errors.txt. grep "Error" app.log >> server.log
- Change the permissions of errors.txt so that it is "Read Only" for everyone. chmod 400 server.log

Networking and connectivity
|Command,Purpose|MERN Use Case|
|curl -I localhost:5000|Fetch HTTP headers|Check if your Express server is alive.|
|ping google.com|Check connectivity|Is the server connected to the internet?|
|nslookup google.com|DNS lookup|"Verify if your domain (e.g. api.myapp.com) points to the right IP."|
|lsof -i :5000|List Open Files|"Find which process is ""hogging"" port 5000 (usually a zombie Node process)."|
|netstat -tuln|List active ports|See all listening ports on your machine.|

System Resources & Processes
Use these when your Node.js app is running slow or crashing due to memory leaks.
Command,Purpose,Why it matters
top or htop,Interactive process viewer,See which process is eating your CPU/RAM.
df -h,Disk free space,Check if your MongoDB database stopped because the disk is full.
free -m,Check Memory (RAM),"See if your server needs a ""swap"" file or a RAM upgrade."
`ps aux,grep node`,Find Node processes
kill -9 <PID>,Force Kill,Hard-stop a process that won't close normally.
