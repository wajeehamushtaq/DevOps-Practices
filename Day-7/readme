## What is Serverless?
In your current MERN stack, your Node.js server is "always on," waiting for a request. In Serverless:

- API Gateway acts as the "Front Door" (replaces Nginx).
- AWS Lambda acts as the "Function" (replaces your Node.js backend).
- DynamoDB acts as the "Database" (replaces MongoDB).

-------------------------
## lambda function
A Lambda function is just a snippet of code. For the exam, you need to know the Handler—it's the entry point for your code.

### Step 1
Go to the AWS Lambda Console.
Click Create function > Author from scratch.
Name: mern-lambda-test, Runtime: Node.js 20.x.
Replace the code with this "Exam-style" handler:
Key Concept: console.log in Lambda automatically sends logs to AWS CloudWatch. This is a major exam topic!

### Step 2: The "Trigger" (API Gateway)
A Lambda function can't be reached by a URL on its own. It needs a trigger.

In the Lambda Designer, click + Add trigger.
Select API Gateway.
Create a REST API (Security: Open for now).
AWS will give you an Invoke URL.

### Step 3: Deployment Packages vs. Layers
The DVA-C02 exam loves to ask: "What do you do if your code needs a library like axios or mongoose?"

- Deployment Package (.zip): You zip your code + node_modules and upload it. (Limit: 250MB unzipped).
- Lambda Layers: You put the node_modules in a "Layer" so multiple functions can share it. This keeps your main code small and clean.

Question: Your Lambda function is taking too long to process data. How do you give it more CPU power?
Answer: You increase the Memory setting. In AWS Lambda, CPU scales proportionally with the Memory you allocate. You cannot adjust CPU independently

### What is DynamoDB?
DynamoDB is a NoSQL Key-Value database. Unlike MongoDB (which you used in MERN), you don't manage the server at all. It is built for massive scale with "single-digit millisecond" performance.

Key Exam Concepts:
- Tables, Items, and Attributes: Equivalent to Tables, Rows, and Columns.
- Partition Key (PK): Used to spread data across servers.
- Scalability: You can choose On-Demand (pay per request) or Provisioned (set your own speed
----------------------------

### Lambda Use Cases: 
Lambda is the "glue" of AWS. 
It stays dormant until an event happens.Use Case
Web Backends: API Gateway receives a request -> Triggers Lambda -> Returns JSON.
File Processing: A user uploads a photo to S3 -> Triggers Lambda -> Resizes the photo.
Data Transformation: Data flows through Kinesis -> Lambda cleans/filters it -> Saves to DB.
Scheduled Tasks: EventBridge (CloudWatch) triggers Lambda every night at 2 AM to generate reports.
