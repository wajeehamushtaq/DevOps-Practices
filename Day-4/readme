## CI/CD
We will use GitHub Actions, which is free and integrates perfectly with your MERN repo.
1. CI (Continuous Integration): GitHub builds your Docker images and pushes them to your Amazon ECR.
2. CD (Continuous Deployment): GitHub SSHes into your EC2 and runs docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d.

In root project, create a directory structure: .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

🧩 Architecture Flow
- Image pushed to ECR
- GitHub Action runs (manually, scheduled, or via ECR event bridge → repository_dispatch)
- Action logs into AWS
- SSH into EC2
- Pull latest image from ECR
- Restart container
